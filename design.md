# Design Document: Sound Processing & Display System
 
## 1. Overview
 
 This project is divided into three primary components:
 
- **QT6 Python App (Frontend, Sound Processor):**
 Processes audio and captures sound information. Once processed, it sends data to the backend.
 
- **FastAPI Backend:**
 Exposes RESTful (and optionally WebSocket) endpoints to receive processed audio data from the QT6 app and also serve this data for web display.
 
- **Web Frontend (React):**
 A modern, component-based user interface that consumes backend endpoints and displays the audio information.
 
## 2. System Architecture
 
**Component Interaction:**
 
- **QT6 App:**
 Captures and processes audio, then sends processed data via HTTP (or WebSocket) calls to the FastAPI backend.
 
- **FastAPI Backend:**
 Receives data from the QT6 app at specific endpoints, processes or stores the data as needed, and serves the data to the web frontend.
 
- **Web Frontend:**
 Made with React, dynamically queries the FastAPI endpoints and renders real-time audio information in a user-friendly format.
 
 ## 3. Folder & Code Distribution
 
 A clear separation of code concerns increases the maintainability and scalability of your project. The recommended folder structure is:
 
 ```
 project-root/
 ├── backend/# FastAPI related code
 │ ├── app/# FastAPI package
 │ │ ├── __init__.py
 │ │ ├── main.py # Application entry point
 │ │ ├── routes/ # API endpoints (e.g., sound data routes)
 │ │ ├── models/ # Pydantic/ORM models
 │ │ └── services/ # Business logic (process/transform audio data)
 │ ├── requirements.txt# FastAPI dependencies (subset from global file)
 │ └── Dockerfile# Containerization (if needed)
 │

 ```
 
**Note:**
- The global `requirements.txt` file contains dependencies for audio processing, QT6, FastAPI, testing, and development tools. Each component (backend or QT6 app) may have its own subset of these dependencies for clarity during deployment.
 
## 4. Technology Choices
 
### QT6 Python App:
- **Framework:** PyQt6 (or PySide6) based on QT6.
- **Purpose:**
- Capture and process audio using libraries like `soundcard`, `soundfile`, `pulsectl`, and `sounddevice`.
- Utilize numpy for numerical processing.
- Create a GUI that might include design files (e.g., Qt Designer’s `.ui` files) to display status or for local configuration.
- **Communication:**
 Sends processed sound data to the FastAPI backend via HTTP requests or WebSocket connections.
 
### FastAPI Backend:
- **Framework:** FastAPI for building a high-performance, asynchronous API service.
- **Core Components:**
- **Routes:** Define endpoints to receive and deliver audio data.
- **Models:** Use Pydantic models to validate data and possibly ORM models if database integration is required.
 - **Services:** Implement business logic to process incoming data.
- **Security & Dependencies:**
 Includes libraries like `python-jose`, `passlib`, and `python-dotenv` for security management, alongside `python-multipart` for file uploads if needed.
- **Deployment:**
 Uvicorn serves as the ASGI server, and Docker containerization is supported for production environments.
 
### Web Frontend:
- **Framework:** React, a modern JavaScript framework.
- **Bootstrapping:**
 Recommended to create the project using Create React App or Vite.
- **User Interface:**
 Utilizes modern UI libraries and fetches data from FastAPI using Axios or similar libraries.
- **Benefits:**
 React’s component-based architecture makes the UI code modular and maintainable, while integration with FastAPI remains straightforward via well-defined API endpoints.
 
## 5. Communication and Data Flow
 
1. **Audio Data Flow (QT6 to FastAPI):**
 - The QT6 app processes audio data in real-time.
 - It packages this data (potentially using JSON or another format) and sends it via an HTTP POST (or WebSocket message) to a dedicated FastAPI endpoint.
 - Security mechanisms (such as API key validation or HTTPS) should be implemented for secure data transmission.
 
2. **Display Data Flow (FastAPI to Web Frontend):**
 - The FastAPI backend processes or stores the received audio data.
 - It then exposes GET endpoints that the React web frontend consumes.
 - The web frontend periodically polls or subscribes to these endpoints to update the UI dynamically, ensuring live sound information display.
 
## 6. Additional Considerations
 
- **Configuration Management:**
 Use separate configuration files (e.g., `backend.yaml` and `frontend.yaml`) to handle environment-specific settings across development and production.
 
- **Error Handling & Logging:**
 Each component (QT6 app and FastAPI) should implement robust error handling and centralized logging. For FastAPI, middleware or standard logging practices are recommended, and for the QT6 app, proper exception handling in GUI and background threads is essential.
 
- **Testing & CI/CD:**
 Tools such as pytest, pytest-asyncio, and httpx are included for testing. Establish separate test pipelines for each component. Integrate global static code analysis tools like black, flake8, and isort from the provided `requirements.txt` into your CI/CD pipeline.
 
- **Containerization & Deployment:**
 Separate Dockerfiles for the backend and QT6 frontend will facilitate independent development, testing, and scaled deployments. Docker Compose may be used during development to run all components together.

This design document provides the blueprint for the development and integration of the sound processing system, ensuring that the QT6 audio processing module, the FastAPI backend, and the React web frontend are well-organized, maintainable, and scalable.
